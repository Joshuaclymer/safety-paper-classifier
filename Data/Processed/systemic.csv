0,Forecasting Future World Events with Neural Networks Forecasting future world events is a challenging but valuable task. Forecastsof climate geopolitical conflict pandemics and economic indicators help shapepolicy and decision making. In these domains the judgment of expert humanscontributes to the best forecasts. Given advances in language modeling canthese forecasts be automated To this end we introduce Autocast a datasetcontaining thousands of forecasting questions and an accompanying news corpus.Questions are taken from forecasting tournaments ensuring high qualityrealworld importance and diversity. The news corpus is organized by dateallowing us to precisely simulate the conditions under which humans made pastforecasts avoiding leakage from the future. Motivated by the difficulty offorecasting numbers across orders of magnitude e.g. global cases of COVIDin  we also curate IntervalQA a dataset of numerical questions andmetrics for calibration. We test language models on our forecasting task andfind that performance is far below a human expert baseline. Howeverperformance improves with increased model size and incorporation of relevantinformation from the news corpus. In sum Autocast poses a novel challenge forlarge language models and improved performance could bring large practicalbenefits.
1,Robustness Evaluation of Deep Unsupervised Learning Algorithms for Intrusion Detection Systems Recently advances in deep learning have been observed in various fieldsincluding computer vision natural language processing and cybersecurity.Machine learning ML has demonstrated its ability as a potential tool foranomaly detectionbased intrusion detection systems to build secure computernetworks. Increasingly ML approaches are widely adopted than heuristicapproaches for cybersecurity because they learn directly from data. Data iscritical for the development of ML systems and becomes potential targets forattackers. Basically data poisoning or contamination is one of the most commontechniques used to fool ML models through data. This paper evaluates therobustness of six recent deep learning algorithms for intrusion detection oncontaminated data. Our experiments suggest that the stateoftheart algorithmsused in this study are sensitive to data contamination and reveal theimportance of selfdefense against data perturbation when developing novelmodels especially for intrusion detection systems.
2,AnomalE A SelfSupervised Network Intrusion Detection System based on Graph Neural Networks This paper investigates Graph Neural Networks GNNs application forselfsupervised network intrusion and anomaly detection. GNNs are a deeplearning approach for graphbased data that incorporate graph structures intolearning to generalise graph representations and output embeddings. As networkflows are naturally graphbased GNNs are a suitable fit for analysing andlearning network behaviour. The majority of current implementations ofGNNbased Network Intrusion Detection Systems NIDSs rely heavily on labellednetwork traffic which can not only restrict the amount and structure of inputtraffic but also the NIDSs potential to adapt to unseen attacks. To overcomethese restrictions we present AnomalE a GNN approach to intrusion andanomaly detection that leverages edge features and graph topological structurein a selfsupervised process. This approach is to the best our knowledge thefirst successful and practical approach to network intrusion detection thatutilises network flows in a selfsupervised edge leveraging GNN. Experimentalresults on two modern benchmark NIDS datasets not only clearly display theimprovement of using AnomalE embeddings rather than raw features but also thepotential AnomalE has for detection on wild network traffic.
3,Generalized Beliefs for Cooperative AI Selfplay is a common paradigm for constructing solutions in Markov gamesthat can yield optimal policies in collaborative settings. However thesepolicies often adopt highlyspecialized conventions that make playing with anovel partner difficult. To address this recent approaches rely on encodingsymmetry and conventionawareness into policy training but these requirestrong environmental assumptions and can complicate policy training. Wetherefore propose moving the learning of conventions to the belief space.Specifically we propose a belief learning model that can maintain beliefs overrollouts of policies not seen at training time and can thus decode and adaptto novel conventions at test time. We show how to leverage this model for bothsearch and training of a best response over various pools of policies togreatly improve adhoc teamplay. We also show how our setup promotesexplainability and interpretability of nuanced agent conventions.

5,Open Problems in Cooperative AI Problems of cooperationin which agents seek ways to jointly improve theirwelfareare ubiquitous and important. They can be found at scales ranging fromour daily routinessuch as driving on highways scheduling meetings andworking collaborativelyto our global challengessuch as peace commerce andpandemic preparedness. Arguably the success of the human species is rooted inour ability to cooperate. Since machines powered by artificial intelligence areplaying an ever greater role in our lives it will be important to equip themwith the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation.
6,On Single Point Forecasts for FatTailed Variables We discuss common errors and fallacies when using naive evidence basedempiricism and point forecasts for fattailed variables as well as theinsufficiency of using naive firstorder scientific methods for tail riskmanagement. We use the COVID pandemic as the background for the discussionand as an example of a phenomenon characterized by a multiplicative nature andwhat mitigating policies must result from the statistical properties andassociated risks. In doing so we also respond to the points raised byIoannidis et al. .
7,Asleep at the Keyboard Assessing the Security of GitHub Copilots Code Contributions There is burgeoning interest in designing AIbased systems to assist humansin designing computing systems including tools that automatically generatecomputer code. The most notable of these comes in the form of the firstselfdescribed AI pair programmer GitHub Copilot a language model trainedover opensource GitHub code. However code often contains bugs  and so giventhe vast quantity of unvetted code that Copilot has processed it is certainthat the language model will have learned from exploitable buggy code. Thisraises concerns on the security of Copilots code contributions. In this workwe systematically investigate the prevalence and conditions that can causeGitHub Copilot to recommend insecure code. To perform this analysis we promptCopilot to generate code in scenarios relevant to highrisk CWEs e.g. thosefrom MITREs Top  list. We explore Copilots performance on three distinctcode generation axes  examining how it performs given diversity ofweaknesses diversity of prompts and diversity of domains. In total weproduce  different scenarios for Copilot to complete producing programs. Of these we found approximately  to be vulnerable.
8,AnoShift A Distribution Shift Benchmark for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Analyzing the distribution shift of data is a growing research direction innowadays Machine Learning leading to emerging new benchmarks that focus onproviding a suitable scenario for studying the generalization properties of MLmodels. The existing benchmarks are focused on supervised learning and to thebest of our knowledge there is none for unsupervised learning. Therefore weintroduce an unsupervised anomaly detection benchmark with data that shiftsover time built over Kyoto a traffic dataset for network intrusiondetection. This kind of data meets the premise of shifting the inputdistribution it covers a large time span  years with naturallyoccurring changes over time eg users modifying their behavior patterns andsoftware updates. We first highlight the nonstationary nature of the datausing a basic perfeature analysis tSNE and an Optimal Transport approachfor measuring the overall distribution distances between years. Next wepropose AnoShift a protocol splitting the data in IID NEAR and FAR testingsplits. We validate the performance degradation over time with diverse modelsMLM to classical Isolation Forest. Finally we show that by acknowledging thedistribution shift problem and properly addressing it the performance can beimproved compared to the classical IID training by up to  on average.Dataset and code are available at
9,Developing Optimal Causal CyberDefence Agents via Cyber Security Simulation In this paper we explore cyber security defence through the unification of anovel cyber security simulator with models for causal decisionmaking throughoptimisation. Particular attention is paid to a recently published approachdynamic causal Bayesian optimisation DCBO. We propose that DCBO can act as ablue agent when provided with a view of a simulated network and a causal modelof how a red agent spreads within that network. To investigate how DCBO canperform optimal interventions on host nodes in order to reduce the cost ofintrusions caused by the red agent. Through this we demonstrate a completecybersimulation system which we use to generate observational data for DCBOand provide numerical quantitative results which lay the foundations for futurework in this space.
10,HierarchicalForecast A Reference Framework for Hierarchical Forecasting in Python Large collections of time series data are commonly organized intocrosssectional structures with different levels of aggregation examplesinclude product and geographical groupings. A necessary condition for coherentdecisionmaking and planning with such datasets is for the disaggregatedseries forecasts to add up exactly to the aggregated series forecasts whichmotivates the creation of novel hierarchical forecasting algorithms. Thegrowing interest of the Machine Learning community in crosssectionalhierarchical forecasting systems states that we are in a propitious moment toensure that scientific endeavors are grounded on sound baselines. For thisreason we put forward the HierarchicalForecast library which containspreprocessed publicly available datasets evaluation metrics and a compiledset of statistical baseline models. Our Pythonbased framework aims to bridgethe gap between statistical econometric modeling and Machine Learningforecasting research. Code and documentation are available in
